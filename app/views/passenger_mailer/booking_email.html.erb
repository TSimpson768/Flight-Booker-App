<h2>Things to Know Before You Fly</h2>
<p>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!

I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me. Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.

Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is… Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing? They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day.

Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. I hope I didn't brain my damage.

I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.

You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.

I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.

Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot.

Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!

Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom. Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.
